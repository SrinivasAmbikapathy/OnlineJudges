	 * Input: [1,3,5,4,7] Output: 2 Explanation: The two longest increasing
	 * subsequence are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1, 3, 5, 7].
	 * 
	 * Input: [2,2,2,2,2] Output: 5 Explanation: The length of longest
	 * continuous increasing subsequence is 1, and there are 5 subsequences'
	 * length is 1, so output 5.
