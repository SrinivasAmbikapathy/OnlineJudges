/**
 * Given a string array words, find the maximum value of length(word[i]) * length(word[j]) where the two words do not share common letters. You may assume that each word will contain only lower case letters. If no such two words exist, return 0.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: ["abcw","baz","foo","bar","xtfn","abcdef"]
 * Output: 16
 * Explanation: The two words can be "abcw", "xtfn".

 * <p>
 * Example 3:
