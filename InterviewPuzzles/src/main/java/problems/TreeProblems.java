	/*
	 Consider a set of resources orga- nized as nodes in a binary tree. Processes need to lock resource nodes. A node may be locked if and only if none of its descendants and ancestors are locked. Your task is to design and implement an application programming interface (API) for locking.
A reasonable API is one with isLocked(), lock(), and unLock() methods. Naively implemented, the time complexity for these methods is O(n), where n is the number of nodes. However, these can be made to run in time O(1), O(h), and O(h), respectively, where h is the height of the tree, if nodes have a parent field.
