 Given a sorter array form a bst such that its complete

 
Write an algorithm to find the 'next'node (i.e., in-order successor) of a given node in
a binary search tree. You may assume that each node has a link to its parent.

Design an algorithm and write code to find the first common ancestor of two nodes
in a binary tree. Avoid storing additional nodes in a data structure. NOTE: This is not
necessarily a binary search tree

Suffix tree implementation

You are given a binary tree in which each node contains a value. Design an algorithm
to print all paths which sum to a given value. The path does not need to start
or end at the root or a leaf
